## Data Extraction and NLP

**1. Objective**:
The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below.

**2. Data Extraction**:
- **Input.xlsx**: For each article in the input.xlsx file, extract the article title and text. Save each extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its filename. Ensure the program extracts only the article title and text, excluding the website header, footer, or any other irrelevant content.
- **Note**: Use Python programming and libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy for data crawling.

**3. Data Analysis**:
- **Python Programming**: Perform textual analysis for each extracted article using Python.
- **Variables**: Compute the variables defined in the "Text Analysis.docx" document, including:
   1. Positive Score
   2. Negative Score
   3. Polarity Score
   4. Subjectivity Score
   5. Average Sentence Length
   6. Percentage of Complex Words
   7. Fog Index
   8. Average Number of Words Per Sentence
   9. Complex Word Count
   10. Word Count
   11. Syllable Per Word
   12. Personal Pronouns
   13. Average Word Length

**4. Output Data Structure**:
- **Output Variables**: 
   1. All input variables in "Input.xlsx"
   2. Positive Score
   3. Negative Score
   4. Polarity Score
   5. Subjectivity Score
   6. Average Sentence Length
   7. Percentage of Complex Words
   8. Fog Index
   9. Average Number of Words Per Sentence
   10. Complex Word Count
   11. Word Count
   12. Syllable Per Word
   13. Personal Pronouns
   14. Average Word Length
- Refer to the "Output Data Structure.xlsx" spreadsheet for the output format.

**Make sure your submission contains**:
- A .py file
- Output in CSV or Excel file format as specified
- Instructions:
   1. Explaining your approach to the solution
   2. How to run the .py file to generate output
